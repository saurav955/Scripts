This repository contains scripts to ease things up and save your effort.

1) certexpiresindays.py checks the number of days there are before the ssl certificate expires.

Run it as:
python certexpiresindays.py <domain-name>
python certexpiresindays.py facebook.com

Change the port in the script if your website opens at some weird port.

Use it as a nagios plugin to raise reminders or automate the new cert generation process based on it's output (number of days left).

2) permissionchecker.py checks the permissions for files/directories at a particular path against a specified permission and prints the deviators. 

Run it as:
python permissionchecker.py -p <path> -P <permissions> -t <type>
python permissionchecker.py -p /home -P 0700 -t file/dir/both      #Default for type is "both"

Use it for auditing purposes, I used it to check appropriate permissions in some specific locations.

3) html_to_mariadb_insertion.py is used to parse html table and insert table rows to DB rows. I have provided a sample html file named test.html and I have shared the create table table_name output as well.

       Table: table_name
Create Table: CREATE TABLE `table_name` (
  `Event_ID` varchar(10) DEFAULT NULL,
  `Project_Name` varchar(30) DEFAULT NULL,
  `Event_Details` varchar(100) DEFAULT NULL,
  `Start_Date` date DEFAULT NULL,
  `End_Date` date DEFAULT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1

Run it as:
python html_to_mariadb_insertion.py   #make sure that the test.html is in the same directory.

4) rblchecker.py checks a set of IPs with a set of RBLs for black listing. By default it takes it's input from two files containing list of IP and RBLs, but you can have the IP/RBL list included in script as shown in commented part.

Run it as:
python rblchecker.py  #make sure rbllist and iplist files are present in the same directory.

Examples of iplist/rbllist
#######cat iplist 
11.160.116.103
12.160.116.103
13.160.116.103
#######cat rbllist 
0spam.fusionzero.com
0spam-killlist.fusionzero.com
ipbl.zeustracker.abuse.ch

Note: iplist contains the list of ips in reversed order.
