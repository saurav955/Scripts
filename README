This repository contains scripts to ease up things and save your effort.

1) certexpiresindays.py

Run it as:
python certexpiresindays.py google.com
python certexpiresindays.py facebook.com

Change the port in the script if your website opens at some weird port.

Use it as a nagios plugin to raise reminders or automate the new cert generation process based on it's output (number of days left).
