This repository contains scripts to ease things up and save your effort.

1) certexpiresindays.py checks the number of days there are before the ssl certificate expires.

Run it as:
python certexpiresindays.py <domain-name>
python certexpiresindays.py facebook.com

Change the port in the script if your website opens at some weird port.

Use it as a nagios plugin to raise reminders or automate the new cert generation process based on it's output (number of days left).

2) permissionchecker.py checks the permissions for files/directories at a particular path against a specified permission and prints the deviators. 

Run it as:
python permissionchecker.py -p <path> -P <permissions> -t <type>
python permissionchecker.py -p /home -P 0700 -t file/dir/both      #Default for type is "both"

Use it for auditing purposes, I used it to check appropriate permissions in some specific locations.
